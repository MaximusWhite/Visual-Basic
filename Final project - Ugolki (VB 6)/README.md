This is my final project for my grade 12 Computer Science course (2013)

The students were supposed to pick whatever they like as their project and try to implement it within a given period of time.
I struggled with what to work on. I knew I wanted to make a game, but I didn't know which game exactly. 
So, my teacher game me an idea about that game Ugolki ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugolki ). 
At first, I thought that it would be boring, but then I got an idea: what if I make it work over a network? 

Also, from the past I already knew the notion of an Object in programming and wanted to experiment in creating my own classes and objects.

As a result, I implemented Ugolki in a way that allows to play either on one computer (switching turns) OR via LAN (no Internet, sorry).
